The ways that key ideas from functional and logical languages have been recently integrated into imperative languages will also be explored.\n","* What *mechanisms* do modern programming languages support?\n","  - This material will primarily examine a range of language design features, possible implementations of those features, and costs for supporting such features. \n","\n","## Learning objectives\n","\n","After successful completion of this course, students should be able to: \n","\n","1. Make use of and, for low to medium complexity scenarios, design computational tools that represent/recognize language structures\n","2. Justify the design of a programming language feature based on the context of its use\n","3. Simulate the mechanisms behind the implementations of programming language features\n","4. Read and interpret solutions to non-trivial problems written in non-imperative programming languages\n","5. Write solutions to low complexity problems with non-imperative programming languages\n","6. Provide written interpretations of code and analyses for other computer scientists to consume\n","7. Design approriate tests for developed solutions\n","\n","\n","## Weekly flow of the course\n","\n","On *Thursday* of each week, within a few hours after class ends, you will be provided access to a new module in Canvas that will be the focus for the next week.  The module will consist of three parts, named *Preparation*, *Engagement*, and *Departure*.\n","\n","The *Preparation* is for you to prepare for the week and work for it should be done between the Thursday it is released and the Tuesday before we meet again. I expect the work in the *Preparation* part of each module should take between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete. It will consist of:\n","\n","* A brief introduction to and motivation for the content that will be studied\n","* A list of learning objectives for the upcoming week\n","* Links to a set of PDFs to read and videos to watch as preparation for the week\n","* A small set of questions relating to the content in the preparation material. These questions, which you will be asked to submit answers to by *midnight on Mondays*, will allow me to gain insight into your initial understanding of the material.\n","\n","*Engagement* happens on Tuesdays and Thursdays during our normal class times, as well as can happen during office hours. The majority of class sessions will be a mix of both lecture to reinforce ideas and engagement with a set of problems relating to the material. Our primary goal will be to use this time we have together (student-instructor and student-student) in order to address the course learning objectives.\n","\n","Finally, after Thursday, the *Departure* component of the module will consist of a set of after-class problems also due the following *Monday at midnight*. These are to provide additional practice with the material and types of problems we have been addressing and will make use of automated feedback.  Note that this means once the class gets going, you will have two items due on Mondays at midnight: \n","\n","* the *pre-class Preparation activity* for the material in the upcoming week \n","* the *post-class Departure activity* for the material from the current week\n","\n","## Prior knowledge assumptions\n","\n","Students are expected to have background knowledge equivalent to the completion of the WFU courses of CSC 111, CSC 112, and MST 117.  In particular, all students are expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of computer programming and have some experience with recursion.\n","\n","## Course work and assessment\n","\n","### Types of assessments\n","\n","In most weeks, there should be two assignments due each Monday at midnight - the *Preparation* assignment for the new module being introduced and the *Departure* assignment for the current module. While the gradebook will inititally show how many answers you got correct as the score for the *Preparation* and *Departure* assignments, at the end of the term those assignments will be given a mark of 1 for *Satisfactory* or 0 for *Unsatisfactory*. They will be marked (graded) based primarily on effort and intention, and they will play a small role in your overall final grade.\n","\n","There will also be *evaluations (tests)*.  There will be three tests over the semester, including the final exam. The three tests will be closed-book, done-in-class tests.  The tests will not be explicitly cumulative, other than the natural fact that ideas introduced later in the course build on ideas from earlier in the course.\n","\n","There will also be *projects (programming assignments)*. There will be four projects over the semester. Given the nature of the auto-grading system that will be used to compute part of the project grade, you will be able to submit a project and get automated feedback multiple times before the due date.\n","\n","## Course grades\n","\n","Each of the tests will be worth a total of 60 points each. The scores given for submitted answers to problems will depend on correctness, completeness, and clarity and partial credit will be given. A total of 180 points can be earned from the tests.\n","\n","Each of the projects will be worth a total of 30 points each. The scores given for projects will be based on a rubric shared with each project which will include correctness, completeness, and clarity. Projects will be partially auto-graded. A total of 120 points can be earned from the projects.\n","\n","The final grade, as a value between `0` and `100`, will be computed based on the following formula:\n","\n","$\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} Test_{i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{4} Project_{i}}{300} - PreparationDepartureModifier$\n","\n","where `PreparationDepatureModifier` is a value between `0` and `2` (inclusive) of points *lost* on the final grade based on the percentage of *Preparation* and *Departure* assignments marked as *Satisfactory*.\n","\n","| Percentage of assignments marked as *Satisfactory* | PreparationDepartureModifier score (effectively, points lost) |\n","|:--:|:--:|\n","| >= 75%  | 0 |\n","| >= 50% and < 75%  | 1 |\n","| < 50%   | 2 |\n","\n","Effectively each test is 20% of the final grade, each project 10% of the final grade, and not completing *Preparation* and *Departure* assignments leads to a grade penalty.\n","\n","Given the above calculation, the resulting numerical grade value will be converted to a letter grade based on the ranges shown in the table below.\n","\n","| Numerical grade value range | Letter grade | Numerical grade value range | Letter grade |\n","|:--:|:-:|:--:|:-:|\n","| 93 - 100   | A  | 73 - 76.99 | C  |\n","| 90 - 92.99 | A- | 70 - 72.99 | C- |\n","| 87 - 89.99 | B+ | 67 - 69.99 | D+ |\n","| 83 - 86.99 | B  | 63 - 66.99 | D  |\n","| 80 - 82.99 | B- | 60 - 62.99 | D- |\n","| 77 - 79.99 | C+ |  0 - 59.99 | F |\n","\n","### Pass/fail\n","\n","For students taking the course pass/fail, only grades at the level of D or above will be considered passing (not D- or F).\n","\n","## Important course dates\n","\n","| Date | Event |\n","|:-:|:---:|\n","| Tuesday, January 10  | First class meeting |\n","| Tuesday, February 14 | Last day to drop without transcript impact |\n","| Tuesday, March 7 | No class (Spring Break holiday) |\n","| Thursday, March 9 | No class (Spring Break holiday) |\n","| Monday, March 13 | Midterm grades available |\n","| Friday, March 17 | Last day to drop with `W`  |\n","| Tuesday, April 25 | Last class meeting  |\n","| Tuesday, May 9 | Final grades due for graduating students |\n","| Tuesday, May 16 | Final grades due for non-graduating students |\n","\n","A course schedule, outlining assignment, project, and test dates, is available in Canvas in the *Admin* module. The schedule can also be directly accessed at [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12d5xIzrsKMsEhanCAGYs6BBAE5kF5N7Z?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12d5xIzrsKMsEhanCAGYs6BBAE5kF5N7Z?usp=sharing).\n","\n","## Course policies and resources\n","\n","### Course attendance\n","\n","While attendance will not directly factor into your course grade, attendance at class sessions is strategic for success in this class.  In particular, it is during class sessions when we will address the most challenging components of the course content and when students will be able to work together synergistically.\n","\n","Please provide documentation of known excused absences, such as for athletic or academic events officially sanctioned by the University, within the first two weeks of the semester.\n","\n","### Late work\n","\n","For the *Preparation* and *Departure* assignments, they will have a grade recorded as a `0` (*Unsatisfactory*) if submitted late. I will still provide feedback on them.  Note that receiving an *Unsatisfactory* on a few should not be impactful on your overall grade, given how the *PreparationDepartureModifier* component of the course grade works.\n","\n","For the *Projects*, you have a budget of `4` late days to use throughout the semester at your discretion. I will help you keep track of the balance of late days you have left.  Here is how the late days work:\n","\n","* You do not need to explain why you used the late day(s).\n","* Each late day extends an assignment deadline by `24` hours with no penalty. \n","* Late day use calculations are rounded up to the nearest half-day increment.\n","  * For example, submitting an assignment: \n","    * `11` hours late uses a *half* day\n","    * `17` hours late uses `1` day\n","    * `26` hours late uses `1.5` days\n","    * ... \n","* You may use at most `3` late days on any single assignment.\n","* Work submitted late when the late day balance is `0` or that goes over `3` days for any one assignment will receive a `0` as a grade.  I will still provide feedback on your work.\n","\n","Make up tests will only be allowed for officially sanctioned University events or clear cases (where *clear* is determined by the instructor) where students are unable to attend class.\n","\n","### Student wellness\n","\n","As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, stressful events, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. Such concerns may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. There are a wealth of resources on campus to help in these situations. A good starting point is the WFU Counseling Center (website: [https://counselingcenter.wfu.edu/](https://counselingcenter.wfu.edu/), location: Reynolda 117, phone: 336-758-5273).\n","\n","If you are experiencing challenges, please reach out to me, sharing as little or as much as you like.  I will do my best to work with you in a fair way to address your needs with respect to the class.\n","\n","### Inclusion\n","\n","Wake Forest University provides reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities and accessibility concerns. If you are in need of an accommodation, then please contact me privately as early in the term as possible. Retroactive accommodations will not be provided. Students requiring accommodations must also consult the Center for Learning, Access, and Student Success (118 Reynolda Hall, 336-758-5929, [class.wfu.edu](http://class.wfu.edu)).\n","\n","Preferred pronouns are not accessible through the roster information available to faculty, but I would like to honor those so please share with me as you feel comfortable.\n","\n","If there is any point where you feel I have acted in a discriminatory manner, I encourage you to bring it to my attention after class so I can correct it in the future.  If you prefer to talk to someone other than me, I would ask that you reach out to Pete Santago (ps@wfu.edu) or Stan Thomas (sjt@wfu.edu), previous chairs of the Computer Science Department.\n","\n","### Academic integrity\n","\n","Wake Forest is an academic community that subscribes to an honor system.  By accepting membership in this community, each student assumes the obligation to be trustworthy in all pursuits. Unless otherwise specified, all work submitted for this course should be your own work and reflect your understanding of the material. Using all or portions of work from current students, previous students, or external (including Internet-based) resources, as well as sharing your work with other students, are not acceptable and are considered a violation of academic integrity. Sharing evaluation (test) questions with others internal or external to the University is also considered a violation of academic integrity.  Violations will be handled through the WFU honor system mechanisms. It is recommended that you retain drafts of your work until the end of the semester in case a question arises as to authorship.\n","\n","### Use of technology\n","\n","In our class meetings, please use whatever technology helps you to learn, under the constraints of:\n","\n","* Do not engage in behavior that distracts others from learning\n","* At Wake Forest, faculty hold copyright over their course content, including the course lecture\n","\n","During assessments, technological tools are not allowed unless otherwise specified by the instructor or needed as an accommodation.\n","\n","### University closure\n","\n","In the event that the University physically closes, the course will continue as an online course with class meetings held through Zoom.\n","\n","As conditions change at the University, it may be necessary to update the calendar for the course, including the due dates for assignments and scheduling of assessments (including the assessments released during the final exam period).\n","\n","### University grievance procedure\n","\n","Per the [University bulletin](https://bulletin.wfu.edu/undergraduate/wake-forest-college/student-complaints/), the grievance procedure for academic setting complaints is as follows:\n","\n","* For complaints in the academic (i.e., classroom) setting, the student should talk personally with or send a written complaint explaining the concern directly to the instructor. Should the student and instructor be unable to resolve the conflict, the student may then turn to the chair of the involved department (in the Wake Forest School of Business, this would be the dean) for assistance. The chair (or dean) will communicate with both parties, seek to understand their individual perspectives, and within a reasonable time, reach a conclusion and share it with both parties. If the student's complaint is not resolved by these procedures, the student should consult with the Office of Academic Advising for assistance. The Associate Dean for Academic Advising will consult with the parties to obtain a resolution. Finally, a student may appeal to the Committee on Academic Affairs which will study the matter, taking input from all parties, and reach a final decision concerning resolution. \n","\n","## Edits to document\n","\n","* `2023-01-03`: Initial draft released\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NQExHs7PtFfC"}}]}
